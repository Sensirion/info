## Preface

The goal of this page is to help users navigate the various driver offerings by
Sensirion.

### «Platform independent drivers requiring minimal porting efforts»

Sensirion is offering reference driver implementations that are meant to
support customers in their product designs. These are tested extensively, and
cover most of the common functionality of our sensors. They are also written in
a platform independent way, to enable easy porting to new platforms. Because of
that, they tend to be a bit more complex than a simple platform specific
library, but offer peace of mind for the user to freely move to a different
hardware platform with minimal adjustments. These drivers are described in
the [Reference Drivers and Examples](#reference-drivers-and-examples) section below.

|---|

### «Platform specific prototyping starters»

We are also offering some platform specific libraries and code snippets to
boost your prototyping activities. We have an extensive set
of [Arduino drivers and examples](#arduino-drivers-and-examples)
and [Python packages](#python-packages), which can be used to communicate with
our sensors via the
[Sensirion SensorBridge](https://sensirion.com/sensorbridge) ([Sensirion Evaluation Kit](https://sensirion.com/sek))
.

We also offer some preconfigured and simplified variations of the reference
drivers for the RaspberryPi platform. See the
section [RaspberryPi Drivers and Examples](#Raspberry-Pi-Drivers)

| [Arduino](#arduino-drivers-and-examples)  | [RaspberryPi](#Raspberry-Pi-Drivers) | [Python](#python-packages)

### «Thank you to the open source community»

Lastly, there's a few third party repositories that we wanted to include.
Please note that Sensirion is creating these projects and therefore being
listed there is not an official endorsement, but there's really great work out
there by our community that we wanted to share with you!

| [Community Picks](#third-party-repositories-provided-by-our-developer-community) |
|---|

Finally, feel free to report any issues you have with the drivers on the
respective GitHub repository. If you have questions beyond the drivers we're
sharing here - for example anything that's related to the sensors themselves,
rather than the drivers - the best way to get help is to use
the [contact form](https://www.sensirion.com/en/about-us/contact/) on the
Sensirion website.

For more information, please also check out
or [Developer Website](https://developer.sensirion.com/).

## Reference Drivers and Examples

Generic drivers for all platforms from small-scale embedded-systems to
full-scale Operating Systems.

### Concept

Our reference drivers are our suggested starting point to implement stable
products. They are tested intensively, and we provide support to our customers
in case they face unexpected behaviour of the code.

It is implemented in a platform independent way, by means of a small "Hardware
Abstraction Layer" (HAL) which abstracts the interface level commands (I2C,
delay functions etc.) from the sensor readout protocols and timing. Because of
that, the drivers can be ported to new platforms rather easily.

We currently support a range of sample implementation. At the time of writing
this document, the following platforms are supported:

- Linux (with the I2C userspace interface, see below for Linux Kernel drivers)
- MBED OS
- Arduino Wire library (plus alternative I2C library)
- Microchip SAMD2
- Nordic nRF51
- STM32F1
- Zephyr (User Space)

The complete list of implementations is availble in the `embedded-common`
repository.

- For devices with an I2C controller ("hardware-I2C")
  <https://github.com/Sensirion/embedded-common/tree/master/i2c/sample-implementations>
- For devices without an I2C controller, whereby I2C is modulated with the help
  of General-Purpose Input/Output Pins (GPIOs) ("software-I2C")
  <https://github.com/Sensirion/embedded-common/tree/master/i2c/sample-implementations/GPIO_bit_banging/sample-implementations>

### Example use

To build a driver, there's three steps that need to be completed:

1. Download the release zip file from GitHub
2. Configure your platform, or build your own platform support file
3. Compile example / integrate into your application

As an example, for the SHTC1 humidity sensor for Linux user space:

1. Download the latest release zip file from
   <https://github.com/Sensirion/embedded-sht/releases> and unzip
2. Copy
   `embedded-common/i2c/sample-implementations/linux_user_space/sensirion_i2c_hal.c`
   to `embedded-common/i2c/`, thereby overwriting the empty sample
   implementation provided as starting point for new platform support.
3. type `make shtc1_example_usage`

After that, you should have an executable called `shtc1_example_usage` that
will read out the SHTC1 sensor. Run it with `./shtc1_example_usage`. Depending
on the permissions on the I2C device file (which is defined as
`#define I2C_DEVICE_PATH "/dev/i2c-1"` in the provided sample implementation)
you might have to add your user to the respective group or run as root with
`sudo ./shtc1_example_usage`.

## Arduino Drivers and Examples

To simplify developing on the Arduino platform, we offer a range of dedicated
libraries. Those are available directly though the Library Manager in the
Arduino IDE or here on GitHub, so installation is just a few mouse clicks away.

our [Environmental Sensor Shield](https://developer.sensirion.com/platforms/environmental-sensor-shield/)
products, which come with SGP30/SHTC1 and SGPC3/SHTC3 respectively:
[Arduino-ESS](https://github.com/Sensirion/arduino-ess)

Finally, we offer some snippets to bootstrap our flow sensor based prototypes
(SLG, SLI, SLS, SLQ-QTxxx, LG16-xxxxD, LS32, LPG10, LD20 and SLF3x):

## Python Packages

The python packages work with our I2C and UART (SHDLC) sensors when attached to
a compatible system. Compatible means, that the system provides an I2C
Interface (e.g. a Raspberry Pi on Linux) for I2C sensors, or a
COM-Port/Character device for UART (SHDLC) sensors. The Python drivers also
work for I2C sensors attached with
a [SensorBridge](https://sensirion.com/sensorbridge)

## Raspberry Pi Drivers and Examples

The Raspberry Pi drivers are [Reference Drivers](#reference-drivers-and-examples), which we
configured for Raspberry Pi and should work out of the box. See the
corresponding README.md files for detailed setup and installation instructions.
